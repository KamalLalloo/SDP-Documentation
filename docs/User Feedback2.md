# User Feedback Documentation (Round 2)

## 1. Feedback Collection Method

To gather structured feedback on our live sports feed webapp (_FootBook_), we created a Google Form with a mix of multiple-choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions. This ensured we captured both **quantitative usability ratings** and **qualitative insights** on design, functionality, and desired features.

- The survey was distributed to a mix of users familiar and unfamiliar with the Premier League, covering both frequent and casual sports app users.
- The form is available here: [Google Form – FootBook User Testing (Round 2)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sEA0Gl-iCdyR8G8HB4YIdV26xRRTl2f2dsrnKm43OXk/edit).
- All responses were automatically recorded in Google Sheets for analysis: [Response Sheet – Round 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jJ90GzaaeBiNat0Jkhj3qqeRZPHjTGaqZHyyPnZtkT8/edit?usp=sharing).

## 7. Conclusion

Round 2 feedback reinforced the popularity of **user-created matches** and **watchalongs**, which were consistently rated as engaging and useful. Navigation remains strong, but **visual design and login clarity** require attention in upcoming sprints.

Compared to Round 1, this round shows higher engagement, with participants giving strong ratings across most features. The focus for the next sprint will be to polish the **UI design** and explore **interactive additions** to maintain momentum.

# Footbook — Overview

## What is it?

**Footbook** is a real-time football (soccer) live feed web application. It delivers live scores, match timelines, player events, and structured data for fans, commentators, and organizers. Starting with the English Premier League, the platform is designed to scale across multiple leagues such as the Bundesliga and beyond.

The app ingests match events (goals, fouls, substitutions, etc.), maintains an authoritative game clock, and serves live scoreboards, timelines, and overlays through a modern web interface.

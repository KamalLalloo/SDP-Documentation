# User Feedback Documentation

## 1. Feedback Collection Method

To gather structured feedback on our live sports feed webapp (_FootBook_), we created a Google Form with a mix of multiple-choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions. This ensured we captured both **quantitative usability ratings** and **qualitative insights** on design, functionality, and desired features.

- The survey was distributed to a mix of users familiar and unfamiliar with the Premier League, covering both frequent and casual sports app users.
- The form is available here: [Google Form – FootBook User Testing](https://forms.gle/VAHaR9THD94svBqZ8).
- All responses were automatically recorded in Google Sheets for analysis: [Response Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YT5DxfYtVcAyE00raI-tyVNzK57pxZpyvRuBQByAL2g/edit?usp=sharing).

## 6. Integration of Feedback

We mapped user feedback to actions taken or currently in progress:

| Feedback                                          | Action Taken / Planned                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Past results harder to view (3.9/5)               | **Fixed** – redesigned results page and improved navigation         |
| Users want player stats and league stats          | **Implemented** – player and league stats added in this sprint      |
| Requests for notifications and highlights         | Logged for future sprints (technical exploration needed)            |
| Customization (follow teams)                      | **In progress** – favourite teams feature currently being developed |
| Strong support for news feed                      | Retained and expanded coverage                                      |

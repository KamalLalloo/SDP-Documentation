# Sprint 2 Documentation

## Goals of the Sprint

- Implement UI and API testing with reliable, non-flakey tests.
- Enable use of external APIs and make the project’s API available for external usage.
- Conduct extensive user testing with a formal feedback collection process and integrate results into development.
- Finalize full database schema, deployment details, and justification of design choices.
- Provide comprehensive documentation on testing, user feedback processes, and automated testing usage.
- Deliver key user-facing features: past league games, user profile (button and page), match viewer, and login page.
- Set up API with clear usage documentation.
- Improve tooling by establishing Jest, ESLint, and code coverage (target: 25% with Codecov).

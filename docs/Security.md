# Security Audit Report

---

## 1. Intro

In September 2025, two notable supply chain attacks were reported on NPM:

- **Debug/Chalk Attack**: Malicious versions of the widely used `debug` and `chalk` packages were published, containing obfuscated code that exfiltrated data.
- **TinyColor Attack**: A compromised maintainer account led to a malicious release of `tinycolor`, which then spread across ~40 dependent packages.

This report reviews these incidents, lists affected packages, checks our project dependencies (both **web-app/client** and **API/server**), and recommends preventive measures.

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### Debug/Chalk Attack

- **Cause:** Compromise of package maintainer credentials.
- **Point of Failure:** Unauthorized publication of new versions containing malware.
- **Execution:** Malicious scripts were added that collected and transmitted sensitive system information.

### TinyColor Attack

- **Cause:** A compromised maintainer account.
- **Point of Failure:** The attacker injected malicious code into `tinycolor` and released it under valid version numbers.
- **Execution:** Downstream packages importing `tinycolor` unknowingly propagated the malware.

---

## 3. List of Compromised Packages

### Debug/Chalk Attack

- **chalk**: versions `5.3.0` and `4.1.2` (malicious backdoors reported).
- **debug**: versions `4.3.4` and `3.2.7`.

### TinyColor Attack

- **tinycolor2** (core package).
- Affected downstream packages included:
  - `@ctrl/tinycolor`
  - `color`
  - `react-color`
  - Several other UI/color-related libraries (~40 packages total).

## 4. Audit of Our Project Dependencies

### Client (Web-App)

- Dependencies include `react`, `three`, `axios`, `framer-motion`, `vite`, `supabase`, etc.
- **No direct usage** of `chalk`, `debug`, or `tinycolor`.
- **No indirect usage detected** in the provided `package-lock.json`.
- Status: **Not compromised**.

### Server (API)

- Dependencies include `express`, `yargs`, `supabase-js`, `cors`, etc.
- **No direct usage** of `chalk`, `debug`, or `tinycolor`.
- **No indirect usage detected** in the lockfile.
- Status: **Not compromised**.

---

## 5. Verification Process

- Automated scanning was performed using the uploaded `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- Both files were recursively searched for references to compromised packages/versions.
- **No matches were found** for `chalk`, `debug`, or `tinycolor`.

## 6. Measures to prevent infection from upstream packages (supply chain protection)

### Preventing Upstream Supply Chain Attacks

1. **Dependency Pinning:** Always pin versions (avoid `^` or `~` semver ranges).
2. **Use Trusted Registries:** Employ npm/yarn with strict registry sources.
3. **Automated Audits:** Integrate tools like `npm audit`, `socket.dev`, or `snyk` into CI pipelines.
4. **Lockfile Integrity:** Commit `package-lock.json` and enforce lockfile integrity checks.
5. **Monitor Package Maintainers:** Track security advisories for critical dependencies.

### Measures to prevent reinfection from the same source (malware protection)

1. **Code Review:** Carefully audit all PRs and dependency updates.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict permissions for build and deployment systems.
3. **Static Analysis & Sandboxing:** Run suspicious dependencies in isolated environments before production.
4. **Incident Response:** Maintain a playbook for quickly rolling back malicious updates.
5. **Custom Scanners:** As suggested, maintain a script to recursively check for malicious packages in lockfiles.

## 7. Conclusion

Our current project is **not impacted** by the recent `debug`, `chalk`, or `tinycolor` supply chain attacks. However, these incidents highlight the importance of **strong dependency hygiene, automated auditing, and proactive monitoring**. By implementing the measures above, we can significantly reduce the risk of compromise in future supply chain attacks.
